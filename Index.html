        <p>Hello everybody, it's me, DJS_YT/Debasis. I am going to write about my life story. Let's begin.</p>
        <p>So, it started when I was around 8 years old. My class 2 almost ended, then my father decided to put me in a hostel. He also admitted me to class 2 again, so I studied class 2 for the second time. After a year, COVID-19 came, and all schools were closed. </p>
        <p>During that time, I got to know about smartphones for the first time and learned so much about them. I was the mobile genius in my house, and I still am. After about two years, lockdown ended, and schools reopened. My father put me in another hostel, where I was so bullied by other children.</p>
        <p>After a year, during summer vacation, my family decided to go on a trip to Puri. We all got ready—me, my brother, my father, my mother, my uncle, another uncle who was driving, and my aunt. We left home around 5 PM. I fell asleep at 7 PM and woke up at around 1 AM or 2 AM for the toilet. That’s when I saw someone...</p>
        <p>I told my father about it, but he said he couldn't see anything. However, I could see someone just staring at me, not moving. I was so scared. We started the car again, and I went back to sleep. When I woke up, we had reached Puri.</p>
        <p>We visited the Puri Jagannath Temple. At the temple gate, there are some steps, and you should never step on the 3rd one. But I did. I didn't know at the time that if you step on it, all the good deeds you've done in life are erased.</p>
        <p>After that, we went to Puri Beach. Then we decided to visit my uncle's house in Cuttack. By the time we reached there, the sun had already set.</p>
        <p>Later, at around 12:45 AM, something bad happened. My uncle, who was driving, lost control, and the car hit a divider, flew over the bridge, and crashed. A few minutes later, a truck driver saw us and called an ambulance.</p>
        <p>The ambulance took us to the hospital. When I woke up, I was in the hospital. My father was in serious condition, so they transferred him to another hospital in Rourkela. I didn't mention earlier that my leg was broken in the accident, but at the hospital, they treated it, and now it's fine.</p>
        <p>That's my story. Bye!</p>
